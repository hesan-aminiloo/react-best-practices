## Noticeable Libraries
<a name="required-libs"></a>
There are hundreds of useful libraries for javascript and react. I didn't want to list all these libs, I just want to list the useful ones that every project needs them.

## File and Folder Structure
<a name="folder-and-files"></a>
Based on what [React](https://reactjs.org/docs/faq-structure.html) says, we have two main ways of structuring files and folders.

  <a name="folder-type-based"></a>
  - [By File Type](#folder-type-based)


  Put your components in `components` folder. Put your helper functions inside `helpers` folder. Put your redux files inside `redux` or `app` folder and so on.

  This way you seperate files by their type.

  *Example:*
  ```javascript
  /**
    src/
    |   App/
    |   |   Actions/
    |   |   |   cartActions.js
    |   |   Constants/
    |   |   |   cartConsts.js
    |   |   Reducers/
    |   |   |   cartReducers.js
    |   |   Store/
    |   |   |   cartStore.js
    |   |   ...
    |   |
    |   Helpers/
    |   |   cartHelpers.js
    |   |
    |   Components/
    |   |   cartHeader.js
    |   |   cartItem.js
    |   |   cartFooter.js
    |   |
    |     ...
  */
  ```


  <a name="folder-feature-based"></a>
  - [By Route or Feature](#folder-feature-based)


  Create folder for each of your pages inside the `pages` folder, then put whatever thats related to that feature inside that folder. Imagine you have a `Cart` folder then you will have all of its components inside `Cart/components` folder. The redux files goes into `Cart/redux` folder and related helpers goes into `Cart/helpers` folder.

  This way you seperate files by the application features.

  *Example:*
  ```javascript
  /**
    src/
    |   Pages/
    |   |   Cart/
    |   |   |   Components/
    |   |   |   |   cartItem.js
    |   |   |   |   cartHeader.js
    |   |   |   |   cartFooter.js
    |   |   |   Helpers/
    |   |   |   |   index.js <- cartHelpers.js in previous example
    |   |   |   Redux/
    |   |   |   |   cartActions.js
    |   |   |   |   cartConsts.js
    |   |   |   |   cartReducers.js
    |   |   |   |   cartStore.js
    |   |   |   |   index.js <- Here you import all other things (reducers, actions, etc.)
    |   |   |   Cart.js
    |   |   |   index.js
    |   |   |   ...
    |   |   Product/
    |   |   |   ... <- Like Cart
    |   |   ... (Other pages)
    ...
  */
  ```


:heavy_exclamation_mark: **My Advice:** Althouth it's more about what you want to do but I found the [feature based](#folder-feature-based) more useful.


## Components
<a name="components"></a>

  [Create more components](https://reactjs.org/blog/2015/12/18/react-components-elements-and-instances.html#summary)
  ```javascript
  import React from 'react';

  const Button = () => (
    <button>
      You can click me!
    </button>
  );

  // or

  class Button extends React.Component {
    render(){
      return (
        <button>
          Or click me!
        </button>
      );
    }
  }
  ```

  **WHY?**  It's cheap to create a new component in react as they are plain javascript objects. Creating more components gives you the ability to reuse your logic and codes easier and avoid repetetive code in your application. It also makes it easier to change or modify your code. Imagine you want to change the color of all buttons in your application, the only place to change is one component instead of every button in your application.

  **NOTE:** Creating components in react is cheap, so try to use them a lot.

  [Use Functional Components](https://medium.com/@Zwenza/functional-vs-class-components-in-react-231e3fbd7108)
  ```javascript
  import React from 'react';

  /**
   * Meh... not bad
   */
  class Navigation extends React.Component {
    constructor(props) {
      super(props);
    }

    render(){
      const { items } = this.props;

      return (
        <ul>
          {
            items.map(item => (
              <li>
                <a href={item.href}>{item.label}</a>
              </li>
            ))
          }
        </ul>
      );
    }
  }


  /**
   *Â So Much Better!
   */
  const Navigation = ({ items }) => (
    <ul>
      {
        items.map(item => (
          <li>
            <a href={item.href}>{item.label}</a>
          </li>
        ))
      }
    <ul>
  );

  ```

  **WHY?**  Functional components are **easy to read** and understand. They are **more testable** since they are just a simple function and even if you want them to have state or lifecycles there would be no problem cause we have react hooks now! Also they have a slightly [better performance](https://reactjs.org/blog/2015/10/07/react-v0.14.html#stateless-functional-components) comparing to class-components.

  **NOTE:** With functional components you'll end up having **Less Code**, **More Testable Application** and **Easier to Read Logic**.
